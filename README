# Based on Javascript code from John Walker (http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/).
# Usage:      
#       For julian to hebrew:
#             @hb = Hebruby::HebrewDate.new(Date.new(2010, 1, 1))
#             assert_equal(10, @hb.month, "Wrong month.")
#             assert_equal("Tevet", @hb.month_name, "Wrong month name.")
#             assert_equal(5770, @hb.year, "Wrong year.")
#             assert_equal(15, @hb.day, "Wrong day.")
#
#       For hebrew to julian:
#             @hb = Hebruby::HebrewDate.new1(15,10,5770)
#             assert_equal(Date.new(2010, 1, 1).jd, @hb.jd, "Wrong Julian date.")
